# Authentication Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to configure authentication in your Supabase dashboard.

## Step 1: Configure Email Authentication

Email authentication should already be enabled by default, but let's verify:

1. **Navigate to Auth Providers:**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/swhinhgrtcowjmpstozh/auth/providers

2. **Verify Email Provider:**
   - Scroll down to find "Email" in the providers list
   - It should show as "Enabled"
   - Click on "Email" to configure settings

3. **Email Settings (Optional):**
   - **Confirm email**: Toggle ON if you want users to confirm their email
   - **Secure email change**: Toggle ON for additional security
   - **Double confirm email change**: Toggle ON if you want extra confirmation
   - Click "Save" if you made changes

## Step 2: Configure Auth URL Settings

**URL:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/swhinhgrtcowjmpstozh/auth/url-configuration

1. **Site URL:**

   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   http://localhost:3000/*
   ```

3. Click **Save**

   - Or click "New Project" to create one
   - Name it something like "Cornucopia Auth"

3. **Enable Google+ API (if needed):**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API"
   - Click "Enable" if not already enabled

4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Click "Create"

   - Click "Save and Continue"

5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**

   ```
   https://swhinhgrtcowjmpstozh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   ```

7. **Create and Copy Credentials:**
   - Click "Create"

   - Keep these safe - you'll need them in the next step

### Part B: Configure Google OAuth in Supabase

   - Google should show as "Enabled" (if you configured it)

2. **Check URL Configuration:**

## Testing Authentication

Once configured, test your auth:

1. **Start your dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Email Auth:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Try signing up with email
   - Check your email for confirmation (if enabled)
   - Try logging in

3. **Test Google OAuth (if configured):**
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Authorize with your Google account
   - Verify you're redirected back to your app

## Troubleshooting

### Email Auth Issues
- **Emails not sending?** Check Supabase â†’ Authentication â†’ Email Templates
- **Can't sign in?** Verify email confirmation is disabled or email was confirmed

### Google OAuth Issues
- **"Redirect URI mismatch" error:**
  - Double-check the redirect URI in Google Console matches exactly:
    `https://swhinhgrtcowjmpstozh.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
  - No trailing slashes, no typos

- **"App not verified" warning:**
  - This is normal for development
  - Add your email as a test user in Google Console
  - For production, submit app for verification

- **"Invalid client" error:**
  - Verify Client ID and Secret are correct in Supabase
  - Check they were copied completely without extra spaces

## Next Steps

After authentication is configured:

1. Run the SQL setup script (`supabase-setup.sql`) in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test creating products and market stands
3. Test image uploads

Your Supabase authentication is now configured! ðŸŽ‰
